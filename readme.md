# Reactive Lumen

This project is under active developement. Please keep in mind that this is
not best practice, its just me trying to get stuff organised for basic api
driven projects. Reactive Lumen is an combination of the Laravel Lumen and
React which provides some boilerplate code to get your api-driven application
based on Laravel Lumen and React up and running.
